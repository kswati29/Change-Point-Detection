# Change-Point-Detection
Using Genetic Algorithm with relevant model selection criteria for Linear regression and Piece-wise regression

## Introduction
**As a Research Assistant, the works demonstrated are a part of the initial stage of research and novel methodology formulation for Offline Change Point Detection.**

Change point detection (or CPD) detects abrupt shifts in time series trends that can be identified by looking, but are harder to pinpoint using traditional statistical approaches. Detection of change points is useful in modelling and prediction of time series and is applicable across various domains including finance, manufacturing quality control, energy, medical diagnostics, and human activity analysis 
Offline Change point detection approaches deal with non live streaming data, and require the complete time series for statistical analysis generally being more accurate. A few characteristics of offline change point detection are: 
1. All data is received and processed at the same time
2. All changes are of interest, not just the most recent change in the sequence

## Contribution
1. Researched and studied 30+ scholarly papers related to additive and multiplicative CPD systems in time series forecasting to guide an innovative methodology for CPD with Facebookâ€™s Prophet as a baseline model. 
2. Assisted in methodology development and built initial optimization models by implementing Genetic Algorithm to Linear Regression, Piecewise Linear Regression to be transferred to time series (AR) model with unsupervised clustering method (MDL- Minimum Description Length) as the model selection criteria.

**Example Code uses two data sets: a simulated data set and Boston data set as an illustration of the methodolody developed**
